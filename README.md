Our project uses filters for image processing, including noise reduction, edge detection, and image enhancement. We implement various filter algorithms, such as median, Gaussian, Sobel, and Laplacian filters, to achieve tasks like smoothing, edge detection, and sharpening of images. These filters improve the visual quality of images by reducing noise, enhancing contrast, and highlighting specific features.
